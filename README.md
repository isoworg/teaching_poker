### Teaching Poker

1. Explain that you need five cards to make a hand - all five cards count towards your hand.
1. Introduce a **high card hand**: one where not all five cards are the same suit, and not all five cards are in consecutive order, and there are no cards with the same index (K-K, 10-10-10-10, 3-3-3, etc.) -- this is the worst ranking hand.
1. Let's call a **high card hand** = 0; and **one pair** = 1
1. Compare several 0,1 hands (i.e. deal two sets of five random cards: who wins?). Include kickers and second kickers.
1. Introduce **two pairs** = 2, continue comparing
1. Introduce **three of a kind** = 3, continue comparing
1. Make sure to really test understanding and constantly repeat the hands, their ranking, their kickers and which beats which. Embed the verbal as well as the visual and conceptual.
1. Introduce **straight** and **flush**, ensuring that it's clear you need all five cards to make the hand.
1. Introduce community cards: 'the board'.
1. Introduce Texas hole cards: 'the pocket'
1. Demonstrate different 'my best five cards' from the hole cards and the board. 
1. Explain that you play the best, even if you don't recognise which are the best.
1. Deal out nine players, hole cards face up. *No burn cards, or dealer buttons or bets at this stage.*
1. Deal out five community cards.
1. Ask which player wins, talk it through. *If a new hand rank appears, explain it.*
1. Deal five new community cards, repeat.
1. At some point, explain that a board with no pair cannot support **full house** or **four of a kind**.
1. Provide tokens to indicate which hand wins, so that certain hole cards collect more tokens than others over time.
1. Repeat this process a lot, explaining how to quickly identify the winning hand (i.e. start at the nuts).
1. Discuss: what kind of hole cards do better than others?
1. Deal nine new players, face up.
1. Ask them to pick their preferred hand. You pick one too (the best available).
1. Deal out a flop and talk through who's winning at that point. 
1. Introduce outs.
1. Repeat for the turn
1. Then ask what's needed for them (or you) to win on the river.
1. Repeat this, dealing only new community cards.
1. Ask them if they want to change their choice. Keep repeating.
1. Without introducing it, deal out nine new hands, face DOWN.
1. Ask them to pick one of them to play, without looking.
1. Go through the hand as usual, asking them how they feel about the strength of their hand at different stages.
1. Repeat a few times.
1. Introduce 25x 2p coins to you and them.
1. Play for an ante of 1 coin each.
1. Introduce the idea of a player's action and how it passes clockwise, starting left of the dealer.
1. Introduce checking and betting (i.e. when there's no bet facing you).
1. Introduce calling and folding (i.e. when there's a bet facing you).
1. Introduce raising.
1. Let them know that they are actually paying poker. For realz.
1. Explain the blinds and how they change for heads-up (i.e. to force action on the dealer in the first round).
1. Keep playing.
